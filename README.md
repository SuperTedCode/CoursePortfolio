# CoursePortfolio
After completing a BSc in Web Technologies and Programming I have completed this portfolio to show the labs, Assignments and projects I undertook over the year.

Please download the Portfolio Project.docx to understand the layout of the webpage. You will need to run this website on a webserver and for 
some labs/projects you will need to install a database. For example in Semester two, Web Application Development, in PHP Lab1 pdf you will 
need to create the web-apps database as outlined in the pdf. It is recommended you install xampp to run apache and mySQL on MariaDB.
